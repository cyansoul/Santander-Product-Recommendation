# Santander-Product-Recommendation
In this research project, I try to take an approximately 13.6 million row dataset containing information about customers of Santander Banks between January 2015 and May 2016 and to predict which products they would purchase in June 2016, which was withheld from us. The primary algorithm used is XGBoost which is based on GDBT (Gradient Boosting Decision Tree).
